# NO WASTE KITCHEN

## Description
Sometimes we have ingredients in our home that we don't know what to do with. We also feel guilty having it go to waste. Am I right? Well this app helps you find recipes that you can use with what you already have at home. carrots, rice, onion? No problem!  

## Installation
No need to install anything at this time. 

## Usage

To start, the user enters the ingredients they want to cook with in the textbox below the header "Fridge Items".

From there, the user just clicks the "Find me a recipe" button.

The application will then generate up to 3 recipes for the user to choose from, as well as a description and ingredient list for each.

As well, there will be nutritional information listed for each recipe.
