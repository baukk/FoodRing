The site has lots of stuff for an absolute foodie and helpful in cooking novices.
You can find simple recipes and then start cooking once you get the hang of things.
The recipes are clear and have good images with them.
Cooking starts by doing the shopping and rather than buying ready-made meals, getting ingredients, peeling, slicing, and roasting them in order to end up with a meal worth eating.
